* Wordpress install process needs to be fixed also: it's easy to forget
  to define what hostname that the wordpress plugin should use. This should
  be an option in the wordpress UI, instead of something that is hardcoded

* tests should be yamlized too, and need clearer error messages. 

* need to hide 'more information' link when there isn't actually more information
  - probably slightly easier now
  - TODO 2024: check


# Misc

 * update reversed to work with new structures -> fin-kpv

 * ie8 rendering bug on flag lists in header on main page, but not on about page

 * detail view, include generation info in opt+shift+? debug

 * change cache settings for plugin js in nginx configs, some browsers are
   unwilling to get a new version even when it exists.

 * refresh settings button in plugin

 * cakefile include build bookmark.min.js

 * a little advertising and such for the reader and page with content in specific languages 
   see script in misc/o

   Add text to reader page: "Here are the top websites that people are reading, did you know you can read them too?"

  For privacy concerns, only include top _domains_ not individual pages. Also,
  split these out by language pair used in the lookup. above list is just
  everything in access logs.

## post launch TODOs:

 * bookmark icon for iOS

    /apple-touch-icon-57x57-precomposed.png
    /apple-touch-icon-57x57.png 
    /apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png 
    /apple-touch-icon.png 

 * translate the mobile bookmark bubble, maybe modify/write one for
   android, where the process is a little more complex
 
 * Link til read i selve ordbok-grensesnittet -- kor?
   -- "Vil du ha oversatt ord i en tekst?" 
   -- "Háliidatgo jorgalahttit sániid teavsttas?"
   -- "Haluatko käännöksen tekstissä esiintyvään sanaan?"

 * autocomplete SoMe variant

## Next:

 * word test-list - https://giellalt.github.io/dicts/checklist.html

## Would be nice


## One page for each language




Probably fixed
==============

# General design stuff

  example from detailed view:
    - lexicon( xml -> parser )
                + language specific formatting (chance for markup)
    -

    - user query -> view -> lexicon lookup results -> formatter ->
      view does some more things, sorting, object manipulation
      -> templates

    - templates obviously handle markup

  this is too much, but it happened because a lot of functionality was
  developed on the fly. now that all the needs from the lexicon and
  morphology are clear, it needs to be improved and simplified.

   - morphology needs:
     -

   - lexicon needs:

     - lexicon-specific formatting must be turned into something the
     application can display.

     - lexicon-specific tags must be turned into something morphology
     can operate on without much effort from a programmer

     - room for entry/word-class specific formatting stuff

   - linguist needs:

     - choose how to display a specific entry type based on knowledge of
       lexicon and morphology, without much effort from the programmer

        - pos=N, type=Prop and has @reg; -> display l/text() with l/@reg
        - pos=N, type=Prop and has @reg; -> display l/text() with l/@reg

     - able to programmatically define links to other entries

     - able to define what paradigm to generate and show with the entry
       - interact with morphology and tags without having to know how
         all the (python) code works
